    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in

    console.log(olimp, players)

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:

    const individual = person;

    individual.heigth = "tall";

    console.log(person);

    // how do we take a copy instead?

    const clone = Object.assign({}, person, {weight:"fifty"})

    console.log(person, clone);

    const dec = Object.assign({}, person)

    dec.nose = 'big';

    console.log(person, dec);

    const dec2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(person))

    dec2.hands = 'small';

    console.log(person, dec2);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
